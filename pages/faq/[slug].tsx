            We use data sourced via the{' '}

            , among other official sources. <strong>Simply put, we send UH a formal email and ask 
            for it.</strong> To promote trust and collaboration, we&apos;ve published all the data 
            used by our site so anyone can inspect it and use it in their own creative ways.

          <blockquote className={styles.question}>
            When will Fall/Spring/Summer 20XX data get added?
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            As of January 27, 2022, requests for new grade data are sent automatically via email to UH.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fall data</strong> is requested on <u>January 28 every year</u>.</li>
            <li><strong>Spring data</strong> is requested on <u>May 30 every year</u>.</li>
            <li><strong>Summer data</strong> is requested on <u>August 30 every year</u>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is to give UH time to finalize their grades and so we are not harassing their staff after or during any holidays. UH typically takes about a week to respond with the data, and sometimes even longer. Once we have the data from UH, adding the data to the site is a semi-automated process that takes about 1-2 hours.

          <blockquote className={styles.question}>
            Is all the grade data accurate?
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            All grade data on CougarGrades is directly from UH and is 100% authentic.
          </p>
          <p>However...</p>
          <p>
            The grade data provided directly by UH can sometimes have some holes, or missing data, in it.
            Sometimes these holes aren&apos;t just areas where a number is left blank, but instead left with a 0 instead,
            when a zero doesn&apos;t make sense in context. For example, a section may be included, but for all letter grades 0 is 
            listed (0 As were given, 0 Bs were given, etc). <strong>This is especially evident for instructors 
            who teach Graduate courses instead of Undergraduate courses</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever we process the grade data, we ignore areas where UH leaves missing data in the calculations.
            Unfortunately, for the case where a 0 is left where it shouldn&apos;t be, there&apos;s nothing we can do
            but include it in the data result, because that 0 could actually be true.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section className={styles.section}>
          <blockquote className={styles.question}>
            Sometimes the &quot;GPA&quot; column is inconsistent with the letter grades that the students actually received. What does this mean? What should I believe?
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This is a very clever observation, and there&apos;s supposedly a rational explanation for this.
            Generally speaking, the data we receive from UH looks like this:
          </p>
          <ExampleTable />
          <p>The &quot;AVG GPA&quot; column is what CougarGrades uses in its statistics. By design, we do not recompute this value based on the number of letter grades received.</p>
          <p>
            You can very obviously see that the bottom 2 rows don&apos;t have &quot;AVG GPA&quot; columns that make sense. However, this data is <em>exactly</em> as UH provided it (with no official explanation). What gives?
          </p>
          <p>
            From this, we can infer that: <u>The GPA that UH provides is not necessarily the GPA that could be calculated from the grade letters received</u>. 
            The leading theory we&apos;ve <em><abbr title="speculate (verb): form a theory or conjecture about a subject without firm evidence.">speculated</abbr></em> from this is:
          </p>
          <p>
            The GPA that UH provides is the &quot;real&quot; GPA that isn&apos;t affected by &quot;S&quot; and &quot;NCR&quot; grades. In other words, it&apos;s the average GPA of what the students <em>would have</em> made if they didn&apos;t receive S or NCR grades, and accounts for all the Cs, Ds, and Fs that would&apos;ve been given in the course.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this in mind, it makes a lot of the lower &quot;AVG GPA&quot; values seem pretty bleak, although this is most likely attributed due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and the abrupt transition to online classes.

          <blockquote className={styles.question}>
            Is CougarGrades meant to shame instructors for being too hard/easy?
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            First and foremost, CougarGrades is about bringing <strong>transparent, unbiased information to students</strong> so that they can make informed decisions in one of the most challenging times of their young-adult lives: College.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <em>very</em> important principle to me when designing and developing CougarGrades was to curate the generalized statistics that students want to know about, but leave the data as <strong>open to interpretation</strong> as possible.
            This is <em>exactly</em> why CougarGrades doesn&apos;t have pages like &quot;top 10 lowest GPA instructors in the school: avoid at all costs&quot;.
            If pages like this existed, they would be over-extrapolating data to slander instructors who are already underpaid and underappreciated enough as it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, if an instructor or individual doesn&apos;t like the way that the data on the site represents them, I can&apos;t do anything about that.
            The University of Houston is a public university, obligated to be transparent about its operations. Being transparent means being open to scrutiny and being held accountable.
