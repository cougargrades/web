# @cougargrades/web
React app that powers cougargrades.io

## Indev âš 
cougar-grades is in private early development and the master branch will get very dirty as a result. This means commits probably won't work if cloned and tried building because undocumented changes could've been made.

## Building: Web App (Firebase Hosting + React)
- `npm install`
- `npm build`
- `firebase serve --only hosting`

## Inspiration
- anex.us/grades/ (author unknown)
- AggieScheduler (@jake-leland)

## Development
