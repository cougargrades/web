## Where do you get the grade data? Is it real?

We use data sourced via the *Texas Public Information Act* and provided by the
UH [Office of the General Counsel](https://www.uh.edu/legal-affairs/general-counsel/texas-public-information/),
among other official sources. **Simply put, we send UH a formal email and ask for it.**
To promote trust and collaboration, we've published all the data used by our site so 
anyone can inspect it and use it in their own creative ways.
