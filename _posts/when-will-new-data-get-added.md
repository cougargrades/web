## When will Fall/Spring/Summer 20XX data get added?

As of January 27, 2022, requests for new grade data are sent automatically via email to UH.

- **Fall data** is requested on **January 28** every year
- **Spring data** is requested on **May 30** every year
- **Summer data** is requested on **August 30** every year

This is to give UH time to finalize their grades and so we are not harassing their staff after or during any holidays. UH typically takes about a week to respond with the data, and sometimes even longer. Once we have the data from UH, adding the data to the site is a semi-automated process that takes about 1-2 hours.
