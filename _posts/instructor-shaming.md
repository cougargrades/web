## Is this website meant to shame instructors for being too hard/easy?

First and foremost, CougarGrades is about bringing **transparent, unbiased information to students** so that they 
can make informed decisions in one of the most challenging times of their young-adult lives: College.

A *very* important principle to me when designing and developing CougarGrades was to curate the generalized 
statistics that students want to know about, but leave the data as **open to interpretation** as possible.
This is *exactly* why CougarGrades doesn't have pages like "top 10 lowest GPA instructors 
in the school: avoid at all costs". If pages like this existed, they would be over-extrapolating 
data to slander instructors who are already underpaid and underappreciated enough as it is.


That said, if an instructor or individual doesn't like the way that the data on the site represents them, I can't do anything about that.
The University of Houston is a public university, obligated to be transparent about its operations. Being transparent means being open to scrutiny and being held accountable.
