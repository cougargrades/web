## Is all the grade data accurate?

All grade data on CougarGrades is directly from UH and is 100% authentic.

However...

The grade data provided directly by UH can sometimes have some holes, or missing data, in it.
Sometimes these holes aren't just areas where a number is left blank, but instead left with a 0 instead,
when a zero doesn't make sense in context. For example, a section may be included, but for all letter grades 0 is 
listed (0 As were given, 0 Bs were given, etc). **This is especially evident for instructors 
who teach Graduate courses instead of Undergraduate courses**.

Whenever we process the grade data, we ignore areas where UH leaves missing data in the calculations.
Unfortunately, for the case where a 0 is left where it shouldn't be, there's nothing we can do
but include it in the data result, because that 0 could actually be true.
